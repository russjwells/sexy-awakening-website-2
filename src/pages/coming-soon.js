    <h2>Repellent</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening allows you to <b>buy digital spray bottles of repellent</b>! Please use it to spray anyone who chooses <b>not to accept your boundaries, or noes</b>, that you sense is acting out of integrity with our service, or is persistantly displaying behavior that is unacceptable to you and persisting in spite of your communication. Sometimes <b>your hard no is</b> what it takes to provide an <b>opportunity for personal growth</b>. We make those fun to deliver. You can also use it if their initial approach was really that lacking. When someone has been sprayed enough <b>everyone else they talk to</b> for a while <b>will be forwarned</b>.</p>
