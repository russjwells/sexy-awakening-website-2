    <p>Explore sacred sexuality and conscious relationships in an intentional transformational space. <br /> Sexy Awakening is the best place online to meet new romantic interests, lovers, and friends.</p>
    <h2>Intentional Swiping</h2>
    <p>Swipe according to your interest... Right for sex, up for romance, left for friendship, and down to pass. When someone swipes you with the <b>same intention</b> you are connected and can begin to message with a clear mutual energy.</p>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We believe that relationships are a <b>transformational experience</b> and we exist in order to facilitate <b>spiritual evolution</b> through relationships and sexuality. We encourage honest communication and radical self-expression on our platform. Sexy Awakening is a place for beings of <b>higher consciousness</b> to flourish and grow. A sex positive and inclusive, yet discerning space held for expression, play and connection. We understand sexuality to be fluid, gender as nonbinary, and that everyone is sacred. There is space for you here.</p>

    <h2>Conscious Culture</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening is a transformational space.</p>
    <p>Sexy Awakening encourages a culture of play, exploration, intuition, and inspiration that is grounded in a deeply rooted sense of autonomy, respect, and soverignty.</p>
    <p>We are creating a culture of consent. In a transformational space it is important to respect each individual's boundaries, and to be able to hold your own. Tools to make this easier are on the way.</p>
    <p><b>Covid Update: </b><br />Please allow this novel environment we are all experiencing to enhance your personal and intimate connections... limiting yourself to two weeks between meetups with a new person is our current guideline. In this way we can successfully prevent transmission and cull lonliness together. If this causes a change in your usual habits... may such a change serve you in your growth... Be well, and namaste folks.</p>
