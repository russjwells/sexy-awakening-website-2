    <p>Explore sacred sexuality and conscious relationships in an online transformational space. <br /></p>
    <h2>Intentional Swiping</h2>
    <p>Swipe according to your interest... as if you had to pick one! Right for sex, up for romance, left for friendship, and down to pass. When someone swipes you with the <b>same intention</b> you are connected.</p>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We believe that relationships are a potentially <b>transformational experience</b> and we exist in order to facilitate <b>spiritual evolution</b> through relationships and sexuality. We encourage honest communication and radical self-expression on our platform. Sexy Awakening is a place for beings of <b>higher consciousness</b> to flourish and grow. A sex positive and inclusive space held for expression, play and connection. On Sexy Awakening there is space for you. We understand sexuality to be fluid, gender as nonbinary, and that everyone is sacred. Enjoy yourselves.</p>

    <h2>Conscious Culture</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening is a transformational space.</p>
    <p>Sexy Awakening encourages a culture of play, exploration, intuition, and inspiration that is grounded in a deeply rooted sense of autonomy, respect, and soverignty.</p>
    <p>We are creating a culture of consent. In a transformational space it is important to respect each individual's boundaries, and to be able to hold your own.</p>
