    <h2>Conscious Culture</h2>
    <p>Sexy Awakening is a transformational space.</p>
    <p>Sexy Awakening encourages a culture of play, exploration, intuition, and inspiration that is grounded in a deeply rooted sense of autonomy, respect, and soverignty.</p>
    <p>We are creating a culture of consent. In a transformational space it is important to respect each individual's boundaries, and to be able to hold your own.</p>
